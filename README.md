Inspiration
After meeting each other for the first time today, we realized how out of touch we all were with social situations. While we were brainstorming ideas, we realized that one of the largest issues plaguing society today is the lack of community between people. So, we decided to develop an app that helps people form connections by providing effective and relevant conversation starters.

What it does
It is an android application that utilizes Google Firebase to store the different conversation topics and starters. Depending on your level of intimacy, you can choose different topics that lead to several conversation starters which you can navigate. There is also a topic of the day function and shuffle function for ease of access.

How we built it
Our application was developed in Android Studio using Java and XML for UI. For our back-end database, we used Google Firebase which we connected to our application using their API. We split up tasks and used Git branches to efficiently and effectively implement our code.

Challenges we ran into
We had little experience with Android Studio and using Google Firebase. We struggled with connecting the front-end and back-end of our app, but we were assisted by the mentors and utilized online resources to come up with a successful, finished project.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite our lack of experience, we were able to come up with a working final product that utilizes new technologies. We put a lot of effort into our user interface, and we were able to connect it to our back-end.

What we learned
We learned how to use new tools such as Google Firebase, Git, and Android Studio. We learned how to effectively work with others in a team, and we were able to have hands-on experience that we would not have been able to obtain from a classroom setting.

What's next for Tête-à-Tête
We plan to implement an SOS system for extremely awkward situations using Twilio, where users may text a number, and Tête-à-Tête will respond with a random, general conversation starter. We also plan to deploy our application to the Google Play store and develop an iOS version in the near future. Our app also will have an option to favorite different conversation starters and save them, as well as add their own conversation starters.
